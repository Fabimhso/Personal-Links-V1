# PERSONAL LINKS 📜

This is a project created by me, Fabiano Oliveira! It consists of a small website that stores some personal links such as PORTFOLIO, PROJECTS, SOCIAL NETWORKS, VIRTUAL CURRICULUM and more.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED ☕️

I used very simple things like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so that more beginner programmers can easily edit it and use it however they want.

## CAN I USE THIS? 🎉

Yes, you can download and use it as a personal website. Feel free.

## CONTRIBUTION ✨

If you want, you can use this to make a contribution to help my project. Feel free to add new features in JavaScript or CSS. You can use BootStrap or JQuery too.

## LANGUAGE 🌐

The project is in Brazilian Portuguese because of my main language (Brazilian). But you can translate in Google Translator and change as you want. The project is very easy to understand.
